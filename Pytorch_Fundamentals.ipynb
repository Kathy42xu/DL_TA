        "Many of the world's largest technology companies such as [Meta (Facebook)](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/pytorch-builds-the-future-of-ai-and-machine-learning-at-facebook/), Tesla and Microsoft as well as artificial intelligence research companies such as [OpenAI use PyTorch](https://openai.com/blog/openai-pytorch/) to power research and bring machine learning to their products.\n",

        "For example, Andrej Karpathy (head of AI at Tesla) has given several talks ([PyTorch DevCon 2019](https://youtu.be/oBklltKXtDE), [Tesla AI Day 2021](https://youtu.be/j0z4FweCy4M?t=2904)) about how Tesla use PyTorch to power their self-driving computer vision models.\n",
